# Salt Masterless Example

This repo contains some artifacts to get basic Salt masterless functionality
working. This example uses Ubuntu, AWS, Git, and Terraform... but you could
certainly swap out those technologies for others (such as Red Hat, Azure,
Blob Storage, and Idem) and accomplish the same goal.

More information on how this works is on the
[EITR Technologies Blog](https://eitr.tech/blog).
